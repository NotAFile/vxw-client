THE BASICS:
	W/A/S/D = Walk
	Space = Jump
	Left CTRL = Crouch
	Left Click = Use Equipped Item
	Vertical Mouse Wheel/Number Keys = Select Items
	Right Click = Use Item in an alternative way (e.g. pick colour for the block, scope for guns)
	Escape = Quit the game


E = Use Object (e.g. go to a mortar and hold E while using it if your server has them)
-/+ = Change Framerate
Left CTRL and -/+ = Change Renderer Quality
Enter = Start Typing Chat / Submit Chat Message
To enter a command in chat, the first letter has to be "/" and after that letter, type the command.
Typical commands:
	help = Displays a help message
	commands = Displays available commands
	server = Display information about the server you are on
	map = Displays information about the current map
	ping = Displays your ping value; the lower your ping value, the less laggy your game is
	switch = Takes you to the spawn menu (team/item selection)
If you have no idea at all, just type "/help" into the chat.
F1 = toggle in-game instructions (but better read Instructions.txt)
F2 = toggle server message (only if available for the current server)
F9 = save the currently visible chat lines (lines that disappear are gone, sorry) into ./chatlog.txt
Alt + F4 = toggle in-game settings (or alternatively press F10)
